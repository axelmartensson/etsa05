\section{Introduction}
Facebook is a social networking platform created by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004.
It was originally designed as a way to communicate and share information for
students attending Harvard but has today expanded to accept people from all
over the world. A more detailed description of it is provided in the following
section. In this paper facebook is viewed as an ICT system. Using the ISO 9126
standard the main quality characteristics of facebook are identified. This
prompts a discussion of the sub-characteristics where Facebook is found
lacking.  One such characteristic of special interest is the accessibility for
disabled people, especially the blind. The problems arising from the use of an
assistive technology called a screen reader are analyzed and a possible
solution for making Facebook more screen reader accessible is highlighted.
Facebook thrives on user generated content, however the handling of this
content is non-transparent. The ethical concerns, notably those related to the
privacy of it's users and to the user generated content are identified and
discussed. In contrast to this; When it comes to protecting the privacy of the
company, they devote a lot of resources to searching the web for violations of
their intellectual property.  Software code is hard to protect under current
intellectual property laws, Facebook's strategy for doing so is examplified
through two law suits and the ensuing discussion aims to provide a deeper
understanding of how large software companies protect themselves against
lawsuits. Not getting sued is a good way to secure the future of the company,
but to be a truly successful company one also has to make a profit. The
business model of Facebook is discussed and the reason that it is so radically
dominant in the area of social network platforms is sought out. The conclusions
from this discussion is used as a backdrop for analyzing how their progress
derives from their business model. Based on a review of the relevant
literature, this paper analyzes the accessibility, ethical, legal and business
aspects of facebook. 

\section{Description of the System}
\label{system}

Facebook is a social networking platform founded by Mark Zuckerberg february
4th, 2004. Originally Facebook was created as a way for Harvard students to
connect, discuss and share their personal thoughts. However Facebook quickly
expanded their user base by allowing users initially from Yale, Stanford and
Columbia but quickly expanded to include all Ivy League colleges and eventually
all of the US and Canada. reference As of september 2006 anyone can create a
Facebook profile, as long as they are 13 years or older and have a valid
email-address. 

Today Facebook has approximately 1,3 billion monthly users and is translated to
over 70 different languages. This has made Facebook the number one biggest
social networking platform world wide. Even though all of this, Facebook is
still growing exponentially. Just four years ago, Facebook had less than one
third of the users it has today. If this trend continues and Facebook keeps
expanding their system to more technology you will soon not be able to avoid
it. Some concrete examples of this is that Facebook recently bought “Whatsapp”
which is one of the largest communication apps available for mobile devices as
well as Instagram which is the fastest growing social platform right now.
reference Now for a technical point of view on the Facebook system. Facebook is
a firm believer in open source and this is well reflected in their system. Ever
since the earlier days of Facebook they have been using many of the biggest
open source projects out there.  Facebook’s servers run a  so called LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack with Memcache. Facebook’s web servers run
Linux on Apaches HTTP servers. Linux for its customizability and security, and
Apache because its one of the most popular open source web servers today. MySQL
is use for its reliability and PHP for being a well rounded web development
language with good support and an active community. Facebook has however stated
that the use of PHP might have been a mistake on their part since it is not
optimized for very large websites. Which in Facebook’s case makes scaling a
large problem.  Memcache is a memory caching system which helps Facebook to run
in an optimized way.

While using all of these large open source softwares Facebook also makes it a
point to give back to the community. Most of Facebook’s projects are public and
are available on yet another open sourced service called github. Here everyone
have access to the source code and are allowed to commit improvements. Some of
the largest contributions by Facebook to the open source community is a system
called phpsh which is a IDE for PHP development. This system was created
in-house by Facebook and its the tool they use when developing PHP. They
decided to make this public to help PHP developers around the world. 

To use the Facebook platform you first need to create a profile including your
name, an email-address and your date of birth. This profile will be your
signature when using Facebook and every action you make while logged in will be
signed using this profile.  When an account is made Facebook is a way for the
user to interact with added friends by publishing status updates, pictures and
video. This published information will show up on friends front page just like
their shared information will be shared on the users. You then have the option
to comment and discuss shared information.


Since the creation of Facebook many more well used features has been added.
Some of these are: The Facebook chat where users can communicate privately with
each other. Approximately 10 million messages are sent every hour using this
chatt. Reference

Facebook groups is a way to gather members with a specific interest or opinion
and share information with this group specifically. A similar thing to groups
is a thing called a fanpage where you can follow updates published by the owner
of the specific fan site.

The Facebook calendar where users can create private or open events complete
with reminders, maps to the location and description of the event.

Facebook applications. Independant developers are allowed to create application
that can be run in the Facebook user interface. These apps can range anywhere
from games to interfaces to other websites. Today approximately 7 million apps
are available on the  Facebooks app center.refer

\section{Quality Characteristics}
\label{quality}

As our society grows increasingly digitalized we are turning more and more
towards socialize and staying in contact through the internet. From this change
Facebook has seen a steady rise of users and currently has 757 million daily
users. With this broad array of users it begs the question as to why people are
attracted to Facebook. By following ISO 9126 standards we’ve narrowed down the
prioritized characteristics for Facebook to be: usability, functionality and
portability.  Being the leading social networking platform Facebook has a
spectrum of users ranging from children to elderly. Older adults that might
have problems apprehending the digital world in the way that the younger
generation does have turned to social media to stay in touch with family and
friends. A telling fact is that in 2010 a study showed that social media usage
of people 50 years or older doubled in a year. To facilitate this wide range of
users with varying internet experience Facebook has to make their service as
user-friendly as possible to achieve greater user satisfaction. Prioritizing
down to sub-characteristics, the main characteristics within usability are the
learnability and operability. By providing guides when changing the user
interface Facebook further proves this to be the case by making sure that their
users are able to effortlessly use their system in a minimal amount of time.
The learnability of facebook also directly links to how useful people find it
to be and improves the overall user satisfaction.  One place where Facebook
falls short in the usability department is in the understandability aspect.
While it’s a system that is fairly easy to understand, most people have trouble
comprehending who sees what. These limitations on how comments or posts are
shared to the public often lead to confusion as the default privacy settings of
Facebook expose large parts of the users profile. To prevent abuse of personal
information users are thereby forced to change their privacy settings
themselves, which might prove difficult to the inexperienced user.
Functionality being one of the major focus points for Facebook stems from
wanting to keep users entertained and using Facebook for more reasons than to
socialize. With an increasing number of reasons to visit the site facebook not
only performs the tasks that the user might require, it also adds new
functionality with the aim of widening its use. By introducing games into
facebook the company has branched towards this end, and with one fourth of
users playing Facebook games it has had a noticeable effect on how people use
Facebook. Facebook also puts a lot of time into being interoperable with other
sites on the internet. Finding use in various areas such as login verification
on SoundCloud and the ability to hyperlink from blogs gives facebook a larger
amount of  traffic. One of the areas within functionality where Facebook is
lacking is in the security sub-characteristics. An example of where Facebook’s
security failed is the case of where an independent security researcher used an
exploit to post on Mark Zuckerberg’s friends-only wall to prove that the bug
needed fixing.          When facebook started out it was a pc specific
application, but as smartphones became popular it brought with it the ability
to have Facebook constantly available. In line with their focus on keeping
users active on facebook a natural step was to adapt to the smartphone
environment in order to make Facebook more accessible. By having a focus on the
sub-characteristics adaptability and co-existence facebook is able to bridge
the distance between people, and allows them to stay in contact at all times.
While keeping high standard related to their prioritized characteristics,
facebook is somewhat lacking in other characteristics such as reliability and
maintainability.  This is understandable to a degree since social media doesn’t
handle critical computation or information and since facebook is so predominant
in social media, people will continue using facebook despite the software
having malfunctions. An interesting consequence that follows from facebook not
having to prioritize having their software working to a fault at all times is
that they’re able to ship new functionality frequently without being overly
concerned as to whether the new features are bug-free or not. This in addition
to having a rapid rollback system gives facebook a different development cycle
compared to other large software companies. Efficiency, the last characteristic
to discuss, can be coupled both to the prioritized and non-prioritized
characteristics in Facebook’s case. The time behaviour can have a crucial
implication on how users perceive new functionality and on the other hand the
resource Utilisation can be closely linked to the Reliability characteristic
which doesn’t necessarily affect the user satisfaction to a large degree. 


\section{Availability for Disabled}
\label{availability}
%:set fo=tqa

% Why are we focusing on the blind?
% What types of accessibility products exist for the blind?
% Which problems are encountered by people accessing facebook with a screen reader today?
% What can be done to improve accessibility of facebook when using a screen reader?

This section will focus on the availability of facebook for blind computer
users. The decision to do this stems from the result of a study conducted by
Petrie et al.\cite{petrie2004}. It was performed using a user panel that
evaluated the accessibility of 100 web pages.  The user panel was comprised of
people with various disabilities affecting their access to the web, such as
blindness and dyslexia. User panel members were told to evaluate 10 websites
and perform two representative tasks on each of them. The blind panel group had
the lowest success rate of all the disability groups represented in the study.
Their success rate was 53\% compared to an average success rate of 82\%.  This
result motivates further discussion of the tools available to a blind computer
user when browsing on the internet.

Blind computer users use a piece of software called a screen reader.
JAWS\cite{jaws} is one example for Windows users. It has a navigation mode for
browsing the web and an editing mode for filling out forms. The purpose of the
screen reader is to read the text currently being displayed on the screen and
then convey this information via speech synthesis to the computer user. Screen
readers read a page of text by simply starting to read the page sequentially
from left to right, top to bottom. The user then has to use this information to
build a mental model of what is presently on the screen and how it is laid out.
The blind user is of course completely dependent on the feedback provided by
their screen reader for interacting with software on the computer. 

Screen readers have not been able to keep up with the advance of web 2.0
technology and sites like Facebook that makes heavy use of such technology. The
front-end provided by these websites is to a large extent powered by
JavaScript.  Common obstacles for screen readers that arise from the use of
Javacript are custom controls\cite{ariaprimer} that are built with DOM-elements
that contain no semantic information, such as DIV-tags. These are then
decorated by javascript to provide functionality.  However, without semantic
information, how is the screen reader supposed to interpret a given DIV tag?  

The W3C’s WAI-ARIA standard\cite{ariaspec} could be used to solve this
problem\cite{ariaprimer}.  It defines an interface for providing semantic
information through the addition of more classes to the DOM.  The standard is
very new and it is referenced at least once in all the papers cited in this
section. It is important to note that none of them provide any data on its use.
Furthermore, the standard  is not implemented in JAWS\cite{hailpern2009}.  Its
most relevant contribution for the sake of this discussion is that it
introduces the notions of role and state for elements of the DOM.  Consider the
case where an element looks like a link and/or behaves like a link, it should
then be given the WAI-ARIA role `link' to enable screen readers to interpret it
as such.  Hailpern et al\cite{hailpern2009}.  suggest that to make custom control
elements accessible to screen readers, they should have a keyboard listener, be
added to the tabindex and have an appropriate WAI-ARIA role.

Another feature of JavaScript is that it  enables dynamic updates of web pages.
This means that it increases the performance of web applications by not making
the browser reload the whole web page when something changes but instead
limiting the reload to a certain region of the page. Screen readers have not
yet caught up with this shift from static web pages with only text links and a
few images here and there to dynamic web content. They do not detect changes
that happen dynamically to the content (i.e after a page has
loaded)\cite{hailpern2009}.  When an event occurs on Facebook, e.g a new friend
request is recieved, the user is notified by a little red icon that appears on
the corresponding button in the topmost navigation bar.  This change is not
detected by the screen reader\cite{buzzi2010} because it is made dynamically by
a script.  The only time that an existing screen reader detects a change is
when doing a page refresh. A side effect of doing a refresh is that the screen
reader loses its current place on the page and then the user has to re-read the
whole page to get to where the change occurred. This can be a great source of
frustration for the user.\cite{petrie2004} 

Support for dynamic updates can be achieved by a combination of two
things\cite{hailpern2009}: First, developers must provide audio feedback on
event, e.g a voice saying ''You've got a new friend request'' when someone
sends you a friend request. Secondly, WAI-ARIA has a concept called ``Live
region''\cite{ariaspec} that enables web developers to mark certain elements
(e.g a table) as dynamically updating. This is meant to enable the screen
reader to keep an eye out for changes happening dynamically in this region of
the page.

To provide a convenient way to access Facebook and other web 2.0 sites,
Hailpern et al\cite{hailpern2009}.  propose an alternative screen reader use
model with a reading mode and a control mode instead of the modes mentioned
above. The workflow of this use model is best illustrated by an example: When
receiving a new private message on Facebook use control mode to navigate to the
inbox and open the message, then use reading mode to read the message.  We
argue that the main advantage of this use model is the increased cohesion
between common application design patterns such as Model-View-Controller and
the use model of the screen reader, thereby making the screen reader more
intuitive to use on a web 2.0 site. It is important to keep in mind that
Facebook is a large website and it has different parts of it that are more or
less intuitive and accessible.

A more nuanced impression of facebook's accessibility is given in Meiselwitz'
and Lazar's \cite{meiselwitz2009} study of the accessibility of Facebook's
sign-up process. They conclude that the sign-up process is ``moderately
inaccessible'' and that it only violates a single paragraph in Section 508 of
the US Rehabilitation Act, \emph{which} paragraph is not mentioned. This study
was conducted using only automated testing tools which is why we regard these
results with a certain scepticism because they fail to encompass the user's
experience of navigating the site, unlike \cite{buzzi2010}.

We conclude from our review of the literature that Facebook still has a long
way to go before it can be comfortably deemed accessible for blind computer
users.

\section{Ethical Aspects}
\label{ethics} 

Privacy concerns: As previously mentioned Facebook has more than
1 billion users with names, email-addresses, birthdates and status updates
connected to them. So what is Facebook allowed to do with this information?
Every user is able to change their individual privacy settings. The only
information you can’t hide is your name, profile picture and your mutual
friends. Other than that you can choose just what you want your profile to
display and who should be able to see it. The Facebook default privacy is to
only let your friends see most of your information since this means you have by
accepting them as your friend let Facebook know that you actually trust this
person with your information. 

Facebook can use and sell all of the information you state on your profile any
way they want, but they will do this by selling a data pile instead of directly
linking your name to the information. For example if a marketing company wants
to know how many people likes their product Facebook will say that “X” amount
of people like it instead of saying [Name] likes your product. By using this
principle Facebook has found a way to sell your personal information without
directly disregarding your privacy. Cause in the long run, who would really
care if a company know that you like their product when your just a number in a
grand total.

One of the only times Facebook will disclose your personal information such as
names, chat logs and time stamps is when when there are reasonable grounds to
believe a crime has been committed. This however varies depending on which
country you are from. If you are from a country with limited freedoms Facebook
might share your information with authorities you might not approve of. This is
a clear case for the “Dual use dilemma” since this obviously can be used for
good by preventing crime and catching criminals, but for people living in
countries with limited freedom of speech, Facebook might aid investigations on
a person which may result in a person getting in trouble with the law, arrested
or even tortured for having the courage to speak up against the government
which obviously is something Facebook would not approve of.

Sharing photos on Facebook: Facebook disclaimers state that when uploading a
picture to Facebook they will get non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,
royalty-free, worldwide license Reference. This does contrary to popular
beliefs not mean Facebook owns your picture, however this allows Facebook to
sell and market your photos for free without having your consent. A common
problem amongst people is that pictures are posted of a user by someone else
and unless the picture in question is violating the terms of service nothing
can be done to get the picture removed and Facebook can use the picture freely,
you can however remove any connections of the picture and your account be
removing any “tags” from the photo, but the picture is still there. This can be
debated as morally wrong since indecent pictures of you on the internet can be
found by anyone, like a future employer.

What can you post on Facebook: With Facebook allowing its users the amount of
free speech it does, controversies are bound to occur. Facebook has set a few
ground rules stating what is acceptable to publish. According to these
standards, here are some of the major things that is not allowed to post:
Reference
 
Nudity or other sexually suggestive content Hate speech, credible threats or
direct attacks on an individual or group Content that contains self-harm or
excessive violence Spam


Repeatedly violating these guidelines will, depending on the severity of the
infringement, result in the user receiving a warning or even getting banned. 

Even though Facebook clearly states what is allowed to post, several
controversies has risen over the years. One of them concerns extreme violence
and breastfeeding.  In the early 2013’s both breastfeeding pictures/movies were
banned from Facebook. Breastfeeding pictures because it was believed that this
violated the nudity and sexual content paragraph of the community standards,
and the extreme violence because it featured extreme violence. The fact that
breastfeeding pictures were banned caused quite some complaints with the
community saying this was a natural thing and not something sexual. Facebook
stood their ground and breastfeeding pictures are still banned today since it
is still believed to violate the nudity paragraph. However Facebook for a
period of time during the late 2013’s decided to allow videos depicting extreme
violence such as beheadings so that people could condemn these acts. These kind
of videos came with a warning that the video contained violent content, however
they were still available for everyone, including children. This decision was
heavily criticised and Facebook eventually changed their policy back to
prohibit these kinds of videos.  This is an example of Facebook banning a thing
most people thinking should be allowed while banning something most of the
community agrees should be banned. Since Facebook has approximately 1,3 billion
monthly user they have a huge impact on what people, especially young people or
children watch and should thereafter make sure that absolutely no violence or
other offensive content is available on their sites. Better to harsh than to
gentle?

\section{Legal Aspects}
\label{legal}

Social media has been around since long before Facebook’s breakthrough, but
Facebook revolutionized the industry by integrating a lot more functionality in
a simpler way compared to their competitors. Now, being the leading company in
its field, Facebook has a large focus on searching the web for violations of
their intellectual property. This concern originates from the fact that
software code, which Facebook is primarily build of, is very hard to protect
within the frameworks of Intellectual Property laws. The IP laws were
introduced in 1867 to protect innovative ideas in the form of the following
rights: Copyright, industrial design rights, trademarks, trade dress and trade
secrets. These rights have since evolved, but as the software industry emerged,
the laws have had a hard time adapting to the protection of software. The
process of protecting software is complicated due to the fact that under
current IP laws the protection of software can be viewed as a combination of
the traits of copyrights, trade dress, patents and trade secrets.  So how can
Facebook defend its software code if it isn’t covered under the IP laws?
Facebook has a very recognizable image, The Facebook logo, the “like” button
and the overall feel of its website all follow the same theme. So while
Facebook has large problems defending its source code it can turn to trade
dress rights to protect their software code. This is a technique which is used
to a large extent in the software industry because of the fact that laws say
that if a trade dress infringement action is successfully won it has the
potential of an all-encompassing protection for the entire application. This
was used by Facebook in its trade dress infringement action against  german
StudiVZ, which was was filed in German and United States courts in 2008.
Facebook claim was that StudiVZ had copied the appearance of Facebook’s
interface to such an extent that users could be deceived into thinking there
was an affiliation between Facebook and StudiVZ. In US courts a settlement was
made between the two parties with StudiVZ paying Facebook an undisclosed
amount, and in german courts the ruling was that Facebook had no rightful
claims and the case was rejected.  The ideal way for Facebook to protect its
source code would be through trade secrets to hide their software code from the
public. And while this would indeed work it is negated by reverse-engineering.
Reverse-engineering means that a person decompiles software and then works
backwards to obtain the source code. This is a process which almost always
favours the person reversing the software in court and also nullifies the
protection of the trade secret since it is known to the public. Facebook has
chosen to guard itself against misuse of this by stating in their Statement of
Rights and Purposes that: ”You will not modify, create derivative works of,
decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless you are
expressly permitted to do so under an open source license, or we give you
express written permission.”. This gives them the right in court against
reverse-engineering that they are able to trace to their software, but it
doesn’t stop their software code protected as a trade secret from being
unveiled. However Facebook has use of trade secrets in other aspects such as
flow charts, feature lists, protocol information and so on.  The concept of
Facebook being a social network platform is not an original thought, and has
been seen before in other platforms such as MySpace. The internet giant Yahoo
with more than 1000 registered patents filed a patent-based lawsuit against
Facebook in 2012  concerning many of the ideas that made Facebook successful,
such as the messaging system and their model of advertising. At the time
Facebook owned just 21 patents, and chose to respond by acquiring 750 patents
from IBM. These patents were then used in a counter-lawsuit against yahoo,
which brought on a settlement. This settlement resulted in a shared licensing
of both companies patents, which means that no further lawsuits between the
companies will be filed over these patents. Overall this provides a deeper
insight into how large software companies defend themselves against lawsuits
concerning software.

\section{Business Aspects}
\label{financial}

introduction:
This submission describes the success of Facebook from a business point of view
considering the fact the company being the leader in social network platforms.
Looking at Facebook today it is often said that it has the most effective and
mature business model compared to other highly developed companies. The
question “what makes Facebook so radically dominant in the area of social
network platforms and how their progress derives from their business model?
will be answered in this section. To give a broader understanding, an
explanation will be given of the concept and meaning of having a model
containing business aspects such as financial factors, targeted customers and
company values.

1. The concept of a business model
A business model purpose is to give an outline about the product/service that's
being offered. The point is to think through, validate and analyse all
different significant elements to make the business logic as presentable as
possible to possible stakeholders. It should conclude elements as target
customers and value propositions. It is important to put a lot of effort into
cost structure detailing revenue streams and profit margins since these are
generally the key for possibilities for a company of moving forward and to
develop even further. 
To pinpoint some key questions that is quite straight forward in a business model:
Who are the target customers?
How will it reach, acquire, and keep customers?
How will it be defined and differentiate your offering?
How will it generate revenue?

Considering a business model in an entrepreneurial setting it is used as
described earlier but it can also be used as something to lean back on to when
managers inside companies are exploring possibilities of taking the current
core of the business to further development and broadening the concept. Looking
at the meaning and benefits of an organized and well defined business plan as
it has been described it is now accounted for that it can be used as a
mechanism for developers making extensive growth in firms and successful
businesses.  

2. Target customers and values of Facebook
Facebook has primary two target customers, private users and business users.
Even though the factor of business users are growing each day the rate of
private users are growing even more. The elusive social network platform is
providing a broad range of space and an environment for the sector of private
users since it was originally originated for them as it was at first built for
students at harvard as a social community. The founder Mark Zuckerberg felt a
platform for students to communicate and to reach out to new friends was a
concept that was needed in that surrounding he was in. What he did not know was
that it was something needed in the whole world. As he helped connecting the
world in all kinds of corners it became an attractive forum for companies to
reach out to potential customers. Since users are already given out their
information and interests Facebook has all the tools needed to know where
comercial should be placed to reach the meant targeted customers. Other
companies who do not have this privilege has to use other resources to extract
information about their targeted customers and therefore have to put more work
and money into it. Obviously this is profitable for both parts being Facebook
and advertisers. While Facebook is a free service one problem Facebook had to
work around was how to get revenue from advertisers but still making Facebook
an exciting experience for their users since having ads popping up while you
are connected is not a desirable experience. On one hand Facebook users want to
be able to access information about products by advertisers but on the other
hand do not want to be felt like it is being forced upon them. 

The concept of Facebook is as mentioned a platform to share, connect and reach
out to friends and the mainly mission is to provide information to the users so
the information wished to be shared actually get to be seen by friends and
intended regions. As Facebook´s one value is to make a bridge between other
channels of communication and information into Facebook so users do not have to
leave their page to get the desired information from outside sites. Integrating
with other platforms such as news sites, providing users with news while
connecting with their daily friends and pages has led the users tending to use
Facebook as an substitute to other news-portals. Another channel of information
Facebook now has integrated with is Google which now has added Facebook pages
updates to their real-time search. In result making it easy to access relevant
information on Facebook from searches made on google. The consequences of this
concept broadening is the factor of wide range of context is put into the
virtual space concentrating it to Facebook creating a lock-in effect on the
users. 

    
Additionally to bridging channels of information, primarily private users,
Facebook has also further developed the platform in offering virtual games to
the users. This way users tend to spend more time on the site and hopefully
reach out and catch the attention of a new group of potential users.

3. Facebook being a service platform
Facebook´s rapidly growth had led it to become the biggest social network
platform with a number of 1.28 billions user. 1.23 billion is using Facebook
each month and 757 million of them is connected every day. Thinking of these
statistics gives a perspective of how big the service platform is. Being a
service platform you would think that the employes working for Facebook are the
ones supplying with the service but since Facebook is a platform providing the
functionality of presented the service the user needs. Considering all kinds of
input has a value in it, the amount of input and information that approximately
1,2 billion users feed to Facebook voluntarily is great resource and value.
Building a network where the users do all the work for them. Due of the great
number of users there is no doubt that it is a popular platform for companies
to advertise on. Companies and firms can now set up a page for the intention of
commercial means and to be able to an up-to-date feed of information about
what's going on with the company . This way the information is out there but
the user can choose to look it up. The great invention of Facebook´s “Like
buttom” gives the users the possibility to like a page and get notifications
pushed to them as the pages writes updates. On the other hand since Facebook
has the information of their users fed to them they can easily promote
different pages to users likely to be interested in what the page is about.
Statistics show that 64% of US top 50 law firms have a Facebook page and 25
million number of small business have a page on Facebook. A total number of 7
million of apps and websites are integrated with Facebook which indicates the
vast range Facebook comes through on the internet. As this goes on Facebook
keeps delivering functionality to their broad range of users and is frequently
launching new features to the platform.

4. The financial aspects
Up until two years ago Facebook did not publicly disclose its ﬁnancial
results but on Friday the 18th of May 2012 was the initial public offering(IPO)
held. Although the IPO almost closed at opening price at 100 billion dollar it
still was one the biggest peak of capitalization in technology and internet
history. The platform being Facebook reached a revenue in 2013 of an amount
consisting 7.87 billion dollars. Its revenue increased by 55% from the year
2012 to 2013. 
Starting with Facebooks cost structure it consists mainly of four different
cost areas; data center, marketing, administrative and research costs. As
mentioned before Facebook has the privilege of the users doing most of the work
for them, although a company so big should entail a grand number of employees.
As of March 2014 Facebook had 6,818 employees and that is simply implying how
agile the company infrastructure must be since so little resources is needed. 
Moving on to the revenue streams as known it is free to join the social
network, you could say that it is partly a stream of revenue reasoning the fact
without users wanting to connect to Facebook there is no way to get earning out
of it. The concept of Facebook is to connect to each other and not exactly to
be connected to outside internet sites if it is not intended of the user.
Considering google as an example on the counterpart. When a user enters google
search engine they already have a purchase intent and is wanting to look up
products with ads and commercial. Facebook users on the other hand is usually
not in a intent of purchasing. Ads reduce the users experience and satisfaction
by trying to turn the users from a non purchase intent to wanting to click on
the ads and therefore making a profit for Facebook and the same time satisfying
the advertisers. How can Facebook not displaying ads and making a poor
experience for the users and still make profit by not trying to force users to
convert from non purchase to an purchase intent? One way Facebook, being this
huge service platform as it is, came up with the concept of offering a game
platform for developers connecting Facebook users with developers produced apps
and games. The applications such as games have to be free to the users the
in-app-purchases however do not have to be. Apps involving games is also very
popular to play at Facebook's mobile app. The statistics state that 59% of
Facebook revenue comes from mobile platforms and the number of in-game
purchases made in 2012 was 27 million. The Amount of hours per month users
spend on playing Facebook games is 927 million hours or approximately 106.000
years/month.
This way Facebook and developers get a win-win situation such as revenue and
branding of developers applications and generates an income to Facebook. Of
course Facebook realised that the income that would come from ads could be of
great value since the ads on their platform would be seen by a great amount of
the 1,2 billion Facebook users. The share of mobile internet revenue worldwide
is 17,5% in 2013. As mentioned in previous section Facebook has the tools to
know what kind of user to target with specific ads and therefor not hurting the
experience that much for the users. In some cases to point ads in the right
direction even might increase the satisfaction of the user surfing on Facebook
especially when trying to merge more channel of communication and service into
one. 

Summary of my part on business aspects..
Yo sum up this section:
Often mentioned as the greatest business plan ever seen becouse..
- the users do the work.. providing with information about interests and
connections.
- agile, inte många utgifter och få anställda.. 
- utnyttjar nätverket till att få andra att dra till sig användare.. 
börjar likna google på det plan att de har information om företag och produkter
som kan hittas på facebook. 
Channels:
Websites, mobile apps
Fb apps and pages
Developers tools and API
De låter andra hemsidor integrera med deras funktioner så som like knappar.

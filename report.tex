\begin{abstract}
Facebook has over the last decade segmented itself as the leading social
network on the internet. This paper analyzes the accessibility, ethical, legal
and business aspects of facebook. 

Method for the study, results and conclusions must be written. 

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Facebook is a social networking platform created by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004.
In this paper facebook is viewed as an ICT system, a perspective that enables
the use of the ISO 9126 standard to identify the main quality characteristics of Facebook. 
This analysis prompts a discussion of the sub-characteristics where Facebook is found
lacking. One such characteristic of special interest is the accessibility for
disabled people, especially the blind. The problems arising from the use of an
assistive technology called a screen reader are analyzed and a possible
solution for making Facebook more screen reader accessible is highlighted.
Facebook thrives on user generated content, however the handling of this
content is non-transparent. The ethical concerns, notably those related to the
privacy of it's users and to the user generated content are identified and
discussed. In contrast to this; When it comes to protecting the privacy of the
company, they devote a lot of resources to searching the web for violations of
their intellectual property.  Software code is hard to protect under current
intellectual property laws, Facebook's strategy for doing so is examplified
through two law suits and the ensuing discussion aims to provide a deeper
understanding of how large software companies protect themselves against
lawsuits. Not getting sued is a good way to secure the future of the company,
but to be a truly successful company one also has to make a profit. The
business model of Facebook is discussed and the reason that it is so radically
dominant in the area of social network platforms is sought out. The conclusions
from this discussion is used as a backdrop for analyzing how their progress
derives from their business model. Based on a review of the relevant
literature, this paper analyzes the accessibility, ethical, legal and business
aspects of facebook. 

\section{Description of the System}
\label{system}

Originally Facebook was created as a way for Harvard students to connect, discuss and share their personal thoughts. However Facebook quickly expanded their user base by allowing users initially from Yale, Stanford and Columbia but quickly expanded to include all Ivy League colleges and eventually all of the US and Canada.\cite{FacebookHistoryWiki2014} As of september 2006 anyone can create a Facebook profile, as long as they are 13 years or older and have a valid email-address. \cite{JohnStrickland2007}

Today Facebook has approximately 1,3 billion monthly users and is translated to over 70 different languages.\cite{StatisticBrain} This has made Facebook the number one biggest social networking platform world wide. Even though all of this, Facebook is still growing exponentially. Just four years ago, Facebook had less than one third of the users it has today. If this trend continues and Facebook keeps expanding their system to more technology you will soon not be able to avoid it. Some concrete examples of this is that Facebook recently bought “Whatsapp” which is one of the largest communication apps available for mobile devices as well as Instagram which is the fastest growing social platform right now. \cite{KateKnibbs2014}
Now for a technical point of view on the Facebook system. Facebook is a firm believer in open source and this is well reflected in their system. Ever since the earlier days of Facebook they have been using many of the biggest open source projects out there.
Facebook’s servers run a  so called LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack with Memcache. Facebook’s web servers run Linux on Apaches HTTP servers. Linux for its customizability and security, and Apache because its one of the most popular open source web servers today. MySQL is used for its reliability and PHP for being a well rounded web development language with good support and an active community. Facebook has however stated that the use of PHP might have been a mistake on their part since it is not optimized for very large websites. Which in Facebook’s case makes scaling a large problem.
Memcache is a memory caching system which helps Facebook to run in an optimized way.
\cite{SteveKampbel2010}
While using all of these large open source softwares Facebook also makes it a point to give back to the community. Most of Facebook’s projects are public and are available on yet another open sourced service called github. Here everyone have access to the source code and are allowed to commit improvements. Some of the largest contributions by Facebook to the open source community is a system called phpsh which is a IDE for PHP development. This system was created in-house by Facebook and its the tool they use when developing PHP. They decided to make this public to help PHP developers around the world. \cite{SteveGrimm2006}

To use the Facebook platform you first need to create a profile including your name, an email-address and your date of birth. This profile will be your signature when using Facebook and every action you make while logged in will be signed using this profile.
When an account is made Facebook is a way for the user to interact with added friends by publishing status updates, pictures and video. This published information will show up on friends front page just like their shared information will be shared on the users. You then have the option to comment and discuss shared information.


Since the creation of Facebook many more well used features has been added. Some of these are:
The {\bf Facebook chat} where users can communicate privately with each other. Approximately 10 million messages are sent every hour using this chatt. \cite{StatisticBrain}

{\bf Facebook groups} is a way to gather members with a specific interest or opinion and share information with this group specifically. A similar thing to groups is a thing called a fanpage where you can follow updates published by the owner of the specific fan site.

{\bf Facebook calendar} where users can create private or open events complete with reminders, maps to the location and description of the event.

{\bf Facebook applications} Independant developers are allowed to create application that can be run in the Facebook user interface. These apps can range anywhere from games to interfaces to other websites. Today approximately 7 million apps are available on the  Facebook's app center.\cite{StatisticBrain}

\section{Quality Characteristics}
\label{quality}

As our society grows increasingly digitalized we are turning more and more towards socialize and staying in contact through the internet. From this change Facebook has seen a steady rise of users\cite{foster} and currently has 757 million daily users\cite{smith2014}. With this broad array of users it begs the question as to why people are attracted to Facebook. By following ISO 9126 standards we’ve narrowed down the prioritized characteristics for Facebook to be: usability, functionality and portability. 

Being the leading social networking platform Facebook has a spectrum of users ranging from children to elderly. Older adults that might have problems apprehending the digital world in the way that the younger generation does have turned to social media to stay in touch with family and friends. A telling fact is that in 2010 a study showed that social media usage of people 50 years or older doubled in a year\cite{madden2010}. To facilitate this wide range of users with varying internet experience Facebook has to make their service as user-friendly as possible to achieve greater user satisfaction\cite{rauniar2012}. Prioritizing down to sub-characteristics, the main characteristics within usability are the learnability and operability. By providing guides when changing the user interface Facebook further proves this to be the case by making sure that their users are able to effortlessly use their system in a minimal amount of time.
The learnability of facebook also directly links to how useful people find it to be and improves the overall user satisfaction\cite{choi2014}.

One place where Facebook falls short in the usability department is in the understandability aspect. While it’s a system that is fairly easy to understand, most people have trouble comprehending who sees what. These limitations on how comments or posts are shared to the public often lead to confusion as the default privacy settings of Facebook expose large parts of the users profile\cite{paul2011}. To prevent abuse of personal information users are thereby forced to change their privacy settings themselves, which might prove difficult to the inexperienced user.             
Functionality being one of the major focus points for Facebook stems from wanting to keep users entertained and using Facebook for more reasons than to socialize. With an increasing number of reasons to visit the site facebook not only performs the tasks that the user might require, it also adds new functionality with the aim of widening its use. By introducing games into facebook the company has branched towards this end, and with one fourth of users playing Facebook games it has had a noticeable effect on how people use Facebook\cite{constine2012}. Facebook also puts a lot of time into being interoperable with other sites on the internet. Finding use in various areas such as login verification on SoundCloud and the ability to hyperlink from blogs gives facebook a larger amount of  traffic. One of the areas within functionality where Facebook is lacking is in the security sub-characteristics. An example of where Facebook’s security failed is the case of where an independent security researcher used an exploit to post on Mark Zuckerberg’s friends-only wall to prove that the bug needed fixing\cite{kumparak2013}.          
 
 When facebook started out it was a pc specific application, but as smartphones became popular it brought with it the ability to have Facebook constantly available. In line with their focus on keeping users active on facebook a natural step was to adapt to the smartphone environment in order to make Facebook more accessible. By having a focus on the sub-characteristics adaptability and co-existence facebook is able to bridge the distance between people, and allows them to stay in contact at all times. 
 
 While keeping high standard related to their prioritized characteristics, facebook is somewhat lacking in other characteristics such as reliability and maintainability. 
This is understandable to a degree since social media doesn’t handle critical computation or information and since facebook is so predominant in social media, people will continue using facebook despite the software having malfunctions. 

We theorize that a consequence that follows from facebook not having to prioritize having their software working to a fault at all times is that they’re able to ship new functionality frequently without being overly concerned as to whether the new features are bug-free or not. Efficiency, the last characteristic to discuss, can be coupled both to the prioritized and non-prioritized characteristics in Facebook’s case. The time behaviour can have a crucial implication on how users perceive new functionality and on the other hand the resource Utilisation can be closely linked to the Reliability characteristic which doesn’t necessarily affect the user satisfaction to a large degree. 

\section{Availability for Disabled}
\label{availability}
%:set fo=tqa

% Why are we focusing on the blind?
% What types of accessibility products exist for the blind?
% Which problems are encountered by people accessing facebook with a screen reader today?
% What can be done to improve accessibility of facebook when using a screen reader?

This section will focus on the availability of facebook for blind computer users. The decision to do this stems from the result of a study conducted by Petrie et al.\cite{petrie2004}. It was performed using a user panel that evaluated the accessibility of 100 web pages. The user panel was comprised of people with various disabilities affecting their access to the web, such as blindness and dyslexia. User panel members were told to evaluate 10 websites and perform two representative tasks on each of them. The blind panel group had the lowest success rate of all the disability groups represented in the study. Their success rate was 53\% compared to an average success rate of 82\%. This result motivates further discussion of the tools available to a blind computer user when browsing on the internet.

Blind computer users rely on a piece of software called a screen reader to use a computer. JAWS\cite{jaws} is one example for Windows users. It has a navigation mode for browsing the web and an editing mode for filling out forms. The purpose of the screen reader is to read the text currently being displayed on the screen and then convey this information via speech synthesis to the computer user. Screen readers read a page of text by simply starting to read the page sequentially from left to right, top to bottom. The user then has to use this information to build a mental model of what is presently on the screen and how it is laid out. The blind user is of course completely dependent on the feedback provided by their screen reader for interacting with software on the computer.

Screen readers have not been able to keep up with the advance of web 2.0 technology and sites like Facebook that makes heavy use of such technology. The front-end provided by these websites is to a large extent powered by JavaScript. Common obstacles for screen readers that arise from the use of Javacript are custom controls\cite{ariaprimer} that are built with DOM-elements that contain no semantic information, such as DIV-tags. These are then decorated by javascript to provide functionality. However, without semantic information, how is the screen reader supposed to interpret a given DIV tag?

The W3C’s WAI-ARIA standard\cite{ariaspec} could be used to solve this problem\cite{ariaprimer}. It defines an interface for providing semantic information through the addition of more classes to the DOM. The standard is very new and it is referenced at least once in all the papers cited in this section. It is important to note that none of the papers provide any data on the use of the standard. Furthermore, the standard is not implemented in JAWS\cite{hailpern2009}. Its most relevant contribution for the sake of this discussion is that it introduces the notions of role and state for elements of the DOM. To illustrate these concepts, consider the case where an element looks like a link and/or behaves like a link, it should then be given the WAI-ARIA role `link' to enable screen readers to interpret it as such. Hailpern et al\cite{hailpern2009}. suggest that to make custom control elements accessible to screen readers, they should have a keyboard listener, be added to the tabindex and have an appropriate WAI-ARIA role.

Another feature of JavaScript is that it enables dynamic updates of web pages. This means that it increases the performance of web applications by not making the browser reload the whole web page when something changes but instead limiting the reload to a certain region of the page. Screen readers have not yet caught up with this shift from static web pages with only text links and a few images here and there to dynamic web content. They do not detect changes that happen dynamically to the content (i.e after a page has loaded)\cite{hailpern2009}. When an event occurs on Facebook, e.g a new friend request is recieved, the user is notified by a little red icon that appears on the corresponding button in the topmost navigation bar. This change is not detected by the screen reader\cite{buzzi2010} because it is made dynamically by a script. The only time that an existing screen reader detects a change is when doing a page refresh. A side effect of doing a refresh is that the screen reader loses its current place on the page and then the user has to re-read the whole page to get to where the change occurred. This can be a great source of frustration for the user.\cite{petrie2004}

Support for dynamic updates can be achieved by a combination of two things\cite{hailpern2009}: First, developers must provide audio feedback on event, e.g a voice saying ''You've got a new friend request'' when someone sends you a friend request. Secondly, WAI-ARIA has a concept called ``Live region''\cite{ariaspec} that enables web developers to mark certain elements (e.g a table) as dynamically updating. This is meant to enable the screen reader to keep an eye out for changes happening dynamically in this region of the page.

To provide a convenient way to access Facebook and other web 2.0 sites, Hailpern et al\cite{hailpern2009}. propose an alternative screen reader use model. A use model is a model of the way the screen reader is supposed to be used. The alternative use model has a reading mode and a control mode instead of the modes mentioned above. The workflow of it is best illustrated by an example: When receiving a new private message on Facebook use control mode to navigate to the inbox and open the message, then use reading mode to read the message. We argue that the main advantage of this use model is the increased cohesion between common application design patterns such as Model-View-Controller and the use model of the screen reader, thereby making the screen reader more intuitive to use on a web 2.0 site. It is important to keep in mind that Facebook is a large website and it has different parts of it that are more or less intuitive and accessible.

A more nuanced impression of facebook's accessibility is given in Meiselwitz' and Lazar's \cite{meiselwitz2009} study of the accessibility of Facebook's sign-up process. They conclude that the sign-up process is ``moderately inaccessible'' and that it only violates a single paragraph in Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act, \emph{which} paragraph is not mentioned. This study was conducted using only automated testing tools which is why we regard these results with a certain scepticism because they fail to encompass the user's experience of navigating the site, unlike \cite{buzzi2010}.

We conclude from our review of the literature that Facebook still has a long way to go before it can be comfortably deemed accessible for blind computer users. 

\section{Ethical Aspects}
\label{ethics} 

Privacy concerns: 
So, what is Facebook allowed to do with with the copious amount of information stored about its users?
Every user is able to change their individual privacy settings. The only information you can’t hide is your name, profile picture and your mutual friends. Other than that you can choose just what you want your profile to display and who should be able to see it\cite{JacobClifton2011}. 

Facebook can use and sell all of the information you state on your profile any way they want, but they will do this by selling a data pile instead of directly linking your name to the information\cite{JacobClifton2011}. For example if a marketing company wants to know how many people likes their product Facebook will say that “X” amount of people like it instead of saying [Name] likes your product. By using this principle Facebook has found a way to sell your personal information without directly disregarding your privacy. Cause in the long run, who would really care if a company know that you like their product when your just a number in a grand total.

One of the only times Facebook will disclose your personal information such as names, chat logs and time stamps is when there are reasonable grounds to believe a crime has been committed. This however varies depending on which country you are from. If you are from a country with limited freedoms Facebook might share your information with authorities you might not approve of. This is a clear case for the “Dual use dilemma” since this obviously can be used for good by preventing crime and catching criminals, but for people living in countries with limited freedom of speech, Facebook might aid investigations \cite{JacobClifton2011} on a person which may result in that person getting in trouble with the law, arrested or even tortured for having the courage to speak up against the government which obviously is something Facebook would not approve of.

Sharing photos on Facebook:
Facebook disclaimers state that when uploading a picture to Facebook they will get non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license \cite{LawOfficeDelsack}. This does contrary to popular beliefs not mean Facebook owns your picture, however this allows Facebook to sell and market your photos for free without having your consent. A common problem amongst people is that pictures are posted of a user by someone else and unless the picture in question is violating the terms of service nothing can be done to get the picture removed and Facebook can use the picture freely, you can however remove any connections of the picture and your account be removing any “tags” from the photo, but the picture is still there. This can be debated as morally wrong since indecent pictures of you on the internet can be found by anyone, like a future employer.

What can you post on Facebook:
With Facebook allowing its users the amount of free speech it does, controversies are bound to occur. Facebook has set a few ground rules stating what is acceptable to publish. According to these standards, here are some of the major things that is not allowed to post\cite{FCS}: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Nudity or other sexually suggestive content.
  \item Hate speech, credible threats or direct attacks on an individual or group.
  \item Content that contains self-harm or excessive violence.
  \item Spam. 
\end{itemize}


Repeatedly violating these guidelines will, depending on the severity of the infringement, result in the user receiving a warning or even getting banned. 

Even though Facebook clearly states what is allowed to post, several controversies has risen over the years. One of them concerns extreme violence and breastfeeding.
In the early 2013’s both breastfeeding pictures/movies were banned from Facebook. Breastfeeding pictures because it was believed that this violated the nudity and sexual content paragraph of the community standards, and the extreme violence because it featured extreme violence. The fact that breastfeeding pictures were banned caused quite some complaints with the community saying this was a natural thing and not something sexual. Facebook stood their ground and breastfeeding pictures are still banned today since it is still believed to violate the nudity paragraph. However Facebook for a period of time during the late 2013’s decided to allow videos depicting extreme violence such as beheadings so that people could condemn these acts. These kind of videos came with a warning that the video contained violent content, however they were still available for everyone, including children. This decision was heavily criticised and Facebook eventually changed their policy back to prohibit these kinds of videos. 
This is an example of Facebook banning a thing most people thinking should be allowed while banning something most of the community agrees should be banned. Since Facebook has approximately 1,3 billion monthly user they have a huge impact on what people, especially young people or children watch and should thereafter make sure that absolutely no violence or other offensive content is available on their sites. Better to harsh than to gentle?\cite{WikiCriticism2014}
